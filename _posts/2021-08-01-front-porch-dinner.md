Our next event in 2021 will be a potluck of sorts. On **Monday, August 16** we
are encouraging everyone to eat dinner on your porch and mingle outside.

For some areas of the neighborhood, it's easier to be together outside in backyards and alley-ways
so talk to your neighbors about whether it makes more sense for you all do use
front porches or back yards.

Dinner time is flexible, since everyone is eating on your own, but we hope most people will be out between **5pm** and **7pm**
