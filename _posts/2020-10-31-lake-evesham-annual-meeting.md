The Lake Evesham Community Association Annual Meeting will take place on **Monday, November 16, 2020** starting at **7:00 p.m.** on **Zoom**.

We'll review the last year (wow, that didn't go as planned...), elect the Community Association board for 2021, and hear from our newly elected district 4 councilman.

Zoom details will be [posted on NextDoor](https://nextdoor.com/events/3778856/) closer to the event.

See Andy's [nominations post on NextDoor](https://nextdoor.com/news_feed/?post=164585549) for more information about nominating yourself or others to run for the board.
