There will be a dumpster on the corner of Melrose and Sycamore for the use of Lake Evesham residents on the morning of Saturday, August 15, 2020. The dumpster is for household trash that is generally picked up as bulk items.

Please do not put hazardous material, building construction debris, electronics, batteries, or tires in the dumpster. These have to be disposed of properly on hazardous materials drop off days.

Thank you, and see you on Saturday!
