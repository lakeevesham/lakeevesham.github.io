The 2023 Community Yard Sale will take place on **May 13, 2023** from **8am - 12pm**.

All you need to do to participate is selling things in your front yard on that date!

## Dumpster

Following the yard sale, on **Thursday, May 18** the city will be providing a dumpster for neighborhood residents to throw away extra trash. Only household trash that could normally be picked up during weekly service can be thrown in the dumpster. Appliances, hazardous materials, and similar things must still be brought to the Sisson Street Convenience Center.
