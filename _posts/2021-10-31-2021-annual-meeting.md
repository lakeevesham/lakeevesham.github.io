The Lake Evesham Community Association Annual Meeting will take place on **Monday, November 8, 2021** starting at **7:00 p.m.** on **Zoom**.

We hope many residents will sign on from the safety of their home. Unlike last year,
the board has created a format that will allow residents to hear what is going on
in the neighborhood and opportunities to get involved with what interests you.

After the annual elections, each board member will describe activities in the
neighborhood. Thereafter, the floor will be open to answer questions and hear
from residents as to what interests you and how we might accomplish that.

So, mark your calendars and keep your eyes out for updates posted right here.


Board Nominations
-----------------

Remember that all 4 officer positions and 7 at-large positions are open to election
each year. If you would like to nominate yourself or someone else for a position, please
[email Ryan Ahearn](mailto:ryan.ahearn@hey.com). The only requirement to run is that the person
is a member of the association.
