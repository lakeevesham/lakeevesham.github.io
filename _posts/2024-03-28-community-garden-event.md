Join us on **Saturday, March 30th between 9am and noon** for a morning visiting with neighbors and tending to Lake Eveshamâ€™s community garden at York Road and Northern Parkway. We will also be cleaning up the green space between Northern Parkway and Evesham Ave.

**Bagels and coffee will be provided** as well as some gardening supplies. Bring gardening gloves, clippers, loppers, and/or shears. No need to stay the whole time, anytime you are available we will be delighted for you to come.

Help us clean up our neighborhood and show we care!
