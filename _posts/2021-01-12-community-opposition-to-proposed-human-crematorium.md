title: Community Opposition to Proposed Human Crematorium
categories: community

As you might be aware, the Vaughn Greene Funeral Home on York Road is planning on installing a Human Crematorium. The Board of the Lake Evesham Community Association is opposed to this installation and would like to submit a letter from the community to voice our concerns.

The Vaughn Greene Funeral Home is located far too close to residential neighborhoods and several schools to ignore the increased pollution that is inevitable with any crematorium.

If you have any objections to us sending this letter, please share your feedback with us [by completing this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScn7Isb0k9lL7bJnDjS733RA4iZPpvG37MbpVNdpZDtDiiKQg/viewform) by **Monday, January 18, 2021.**
