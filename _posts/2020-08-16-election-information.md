The 2020 General Election is coming up soon. Here are some things you should know before November:

* Due to the COVID-19 pandemic there will be fewer voting centers open than normal.
* Mail-in ballots will not be sent automatically. You can request yours and/or get registered to vote now at [https://elections.maryland.gov](https://elections.maryland.gov).
* The State Board of Elections has a [Frequently Asked Questions](https://elections.maryland.gov/elections/2020/index.html#faq) page with more information.
* Early in-person voting will start on October 26, 2020.

It is advised that you request (and send back) your mail-in ballot well ahead of deadlines to avoid issues with delivery. ~~There should also be drop-boxes for depositing mail-in ballots, but their locations have not been finalized yet.~~ [Drop box locations have been finalized]({% post_url 2020-09-20-2020-general-election-update %})
