As a community we can create positive change in our everyday lives, which also includes supporting our local businesses. With that goal in mind, the Board encourages residents of Lake Evesham to support local businesses. Although we encourage residents to support local businesses daily, the board has designated the **third week of each month** as **local businesses week** as a gentle reminder to support local businesses.
