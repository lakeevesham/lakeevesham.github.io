**Update** We have unfortunately had to cancel this event. We hope to bring it back next year with enough time to plan it properly.

The Board is planning a garden tour of residentâ€™s yards throughout the neighborhood ~~on July 9, 2022~~ in **mid-August, 2022**. If you are interested in participating as a garden host and showcasing your yard, please email [Theresa Furnari](mailto:TAFurnari10@gmail.com).

Keep an eye on this page for more details if you only wish to walk the neighborhood and view our neighbor's lovely gardens.
