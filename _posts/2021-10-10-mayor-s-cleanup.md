Lake Evesham frequently participates in the Mayor’s Clean Up and on **October 23rd** we’ll be out there again.

If you are interested in beautifying our neighborhood, please **meet at the Lake Evesham sign**
(located on the green space between Evesham Avenue and Northern Parkway) at **9:00 am** on
October 23, 2021. We will participate in cleaning up the streets in our neighborhood until 12:00 pm.

If we have enough volunteers, we will also remove invasive vines from the trees
in our green spaces. Because it is an outdoor event, masks are not required
but we will practice social distancing. All families and children are welcome.
Please bring your own gloves and tools, if you want to remove vines.

If you are interested, please email Theresa Furnari at [tafurnari10@gmail.com](mailto:tafurnari10@gmail.com)
