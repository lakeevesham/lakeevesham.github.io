The Lake Evesham Community Association would like to hear ideas from everyone on events that can be held
safely in the Winter, Spring, and early Summer of 2021. We're hopeful that with a vaccine we'll be able to
host a Crab Feast in the fall, but what are you interested in doing before then?

We'll be meeting via Zoom on **Tuesday, February 16, 2021 @ 7:30pm**. The meeting link will be posted to Nextdoor closer to the event.
