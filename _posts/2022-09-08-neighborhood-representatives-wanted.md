Lake Evesham is looking for at least three residents who are able to represent the community at two city meetings. We are looking for multiple people so that they can rotate attendance. A summary of the two meetings and tasks is cited below:

## Commander’s Meetings of the Baltimore City Police Department’s Northern District (ND) 

Responsibilities:

* Attend the monthly Commander’s Meetings, held on the second Wednesday of each month from 7pm to 8-8:30pm, usually at the ND Headquarters at 2201 W Cold Spring Ln, Baltimore, MD, 21211. Currently, these meetings are hybrid – in person and Zoom – but in person attendance is encouraged. The purpose of these meetings is to keep the community informed of the events and activities going on in the Department and the ND. Crime statistics and trends are discussed.
* Bring up any issues that Lake Evesham residents or community association officers have raised.
* Prepare a written summary of the discussion, with emphasis on what is of special interest to the residents of the Lake Evesham community.
* Post the notes on NextDoor/Lake Evesham in a timely manner.

## Northern District Community Relations Council Meetings

At this time, it is not yet determined if these meetings (resuming as hybrid in Aug. 2022 after stopping in 2020 with the COVID outbreak) will occur every month or every other month. It is also uncertain what week and day of the month they will take place. The ND CRC president, Christopher Forrest, will work with the Northern District officers to set a schedule. These meetings are run by the community and deal more specifically with community concerns.

Responsibilities:
* Bring up any issues that Lake Evesham residents or community association officers have raised.
* Prepare a written summary of the discussion, with emphasis on what is of special interest to the residents of the Lake Evesham community.
* Post the notes on NextDoor/Lake Evesham in a timely manner.

If you are interested and able to serve as the Lake Evesham represenative(s), for these very valuable meetings to the community, please email [Tafurnari10@gmail.com](mailto:Tafurnari10@gmail.com).
