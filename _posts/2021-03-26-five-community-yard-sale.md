Save the date for our Annual Community Yard Sale! **Saturday, May 15 8am - 12pm** (rain date Sunday, May 16)

New this year: Five communities in One! Lake Evesham, Cedarcroft, Bellona Gittings,
Evesham Park, and Lake Walker will all be hosting their community yard sales on
the same day! The main yard sale will be 8am - 12pm with the &ldquo;after sale&rdquo; from 1pm - 4pm.

Move any unsold items to the curb with a 'FREE' sign on them for after hours treasure hunting from 1pm - 4pm.
Please do not leave items at the curb after 4pm or until trash collection as they will not be collected.

Spread the word and get excited! A sign-up post will be coming in April so we can get as much notice out as possible.
