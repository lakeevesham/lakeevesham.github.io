Our wonderful treasurer, Macky Ayers, has recently moved out of the neighborhood.

In her stead, at-large board member Melina Turtle has been voted in to fill the role. You can find [up-to-date information on how to pay dues](/about) on the about page.

**Thank you, Macky, for your years of service to Lake Evesham!**

As a reminder, all board officers and members-at-large are elected at the neighborhood annual meeting, usually taking place in November of each year. Please reach out
to the current board if you would like to nominate yourself or someone else for a position.
