Due to competing events on the same day as our planned chicken/shrimp feast (Baltimore Running Festival and No Kings events), the Board decided to cancel the 10/18/25 event and reschedule for early in November. We will check with the Church of the Nativity and Holy Comforter to see when they have openings and report back ot the community shortly. Thanks so much for understanding.
