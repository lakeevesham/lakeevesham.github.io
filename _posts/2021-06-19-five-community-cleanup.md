We live in beautiful neighborhoods. To keep them looking good, the residents of
Lake Walker, Cedarcroft, Lake Evesham, Evesham Park and Bellona Gittings will
join together on **June 26, 2021** (Rain date June 27) to clean up our
neighborhoods.

We will meet at **9:00 a.m** at the **Lake Evesham Native Pollinator Garden**,
located on the northwest corner of **York Road** and **Northern Parkway**.

From there we will work in all five neighborhoods as necessary to pick up
trash and recyclables. We will work together **until 12:00 p.m.** and then,
supporting our local businesses and enjoying good food we will join together
at Belvedere Square for lunch at your own cost.

Other light refreshments will be provided to all volunteers at the beginning
and end of the clean up. Yellow safety vests, gloves, picking up trash tools,
and bags will be provided. If you have any other of the foregoing please bring
them as our supplies are limited.

Please join your Lake Evesham neighbors, meet new neighbors and stay as long
as you can. Masks will be discretionary but we ask if you are not vaccinated
to please wear a mask.
