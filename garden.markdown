A unique feature of our wonderful neighborhood is that it is home to a Native Pollinator Garden.

Where was originally a garden installed by the State of Maryland approximately
21 years ago was transformed into its present state 6 years ago, with in part
grants from Parks and People and St. Pius the X. Church.
The Garden was the first urban garden, which was created by Master Gardeners
of Baltimore City and Lake Evesham residents.
Today it is currently one of many urban gardens for creating safe habitats and
to help our pollinators.  The Garden is home to a variety of native plants to
attract and provide food and shelter to native bees, birds, butterflies,
specifically the monarch and swallow tail and most recently a bunny has taken
up residence. The Garden is approximately a 85 by 58 feet plot of land located
on the northwest corner of York Road and Northern Parkway, adjacent to two very
busy transit stops.

The maintenance of the Garden is done by residents of Lake Evesham,
the York Road Initiative (Loyola University Students) and Master Gardeners
for Baltimore City. The Garden does not permit the use of any pesticides.
