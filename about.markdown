Lake Evesham is a neighborhood in Baltimore, Maryland, comprising about 250 households.

The neighborhood rests between Northern Parkway and York Road, near Belvedere market as well the Senator Theatre.

Founded in the 1890s, Lake Evesham originally was joined with the community of Midwood in the 1870s. The property was split up and Lake Evesham was formed. The historic area developed from 1870-1940 and the architectural styles are evident of this. Various styles of the post-war era include bungalows, Victorian style facades and classic houses from the early 1900s.
